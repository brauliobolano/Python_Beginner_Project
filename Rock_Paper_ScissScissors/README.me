**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
This is a simple implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game in Python. The user can play against the computer by choosing either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will also randomly pick one of these options. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

How to Play
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the code.
Run the rock_paper_scissors.py script using Python.

The game will prompt you to enter your choice: 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors.
The computer will randomly select its choice, and the result will be displayed.
You can play the game again as many times as you like by running the script again.
